#The below shows how to Create, Update, Delete and Read data from databases
#This is to create

//Below is how to WRITE and note that we start by sending a query

with app.app_context():
   new_book= Book(id=1,title='Harry Potter',author='Arnold',rating='7.4')
   db.session.add(new_book)
   Book.commit()

  //The below now is to READ from the table all the data
with app.app_context():
    result=db.session.execute(db.select(books).order_by(Book.title))
    all_result=result.scalars()

 //The one below now is to select a READ ONE ROW or entry from the database
with app.app_context():
    result=db.session.execute(db.select(books).where(Book.title=='Harry Potter'))
    only_result=result.scalar()

//Now, below is to update a row in the database
with app.app_context():
    result=db.session.execute(db.select(books).where(Book.title=='Harry Potter')).scalar()
    result.title="Arnold's Book"
    db.session.commit()


//Now, This is to update using the primary key

key_id=1
with app.app_context():
    result=db.session.execute(db.select(Book).where(Book.id==key_id)).scalar()
    result.title="Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire "
    db.session.commit()

//db.session.get(Book id) and db.get_or_404(Book, id),are basically the same thing just that if
with db.Session there is no existing primary key as you mention, it is going to return None and you have to handle the
error by yourself buf for get_or_404, if not found it is going to automatically raise a 404 error


//Now, the below is to delete From the database Table
